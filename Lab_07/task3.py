
# The code above has several issues:
# 1. Files opened for writing are not closed (except for the first with statement).
# 2. Attempting to write to a file opened in read mode (f1).
# 3. Not using context managers for file operations (except code 1 and the refactored example).
# 4. Possible file handle overwrites (variable 'f' reused).
# 5. Not closing files after use.
# 6. Should not write to a file opened in read mode.

# Here is the corrected version of the above code:

# code 1
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")

# code 2
with open("data1.txt", "w") as f1:
    f1.write("First file content\n")
with open("data2.txt", "w") as f2:
    f2.write("Second file content\n")

print("Files written successfully")

# code 3

        data = infile.readlines()

        for line in data:
            output.write(line.upper())
    print("Processing done")

    print("input.txt not found - creating it with sample content")
    with open("input.txt", "w") as f:

    print("input.txt created, now processing...")
    with open("input.txt", "r") as infile:
        data = infile.readlines()
    with open("output.txt", "w") as output:
        for line in data:

    print("Processing done")

# code 4
try:
    with open("numbers.txt", "r") as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    squares = []
    for n in lines:

# Example of refactoring to use a context manager:
# Old way (problematic):
# f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
# data = f.read()
# # forgot to close f

# Refactored using context manager:
try:
    with open("myfile.txt", "r") as f:
        data = f.read()
        print("Data read from myfile.txt:", data)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("myfile.txt not found - creating it with sample content")
    with open("myfile.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Sample content for demonstration")
    print("myfile.txt created successfully")
